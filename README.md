# Discord-Firebase Authentication System

This repository contains a full-stack application that integrates Discord OAuth2 for authentication with Firebase to manage authenticated sessions. The system is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend (`discord-auth-backend`)**: Implemented with NestJS, it handles Discord OAuth2 authentication, user data retrieval, and Firebase custom token generation.
- **Frontend (`discord-auth-frontend`)**: Built with React, it utilizes Firebase to authenticate users based on the tokens generated by the backend and manage user sessions.
